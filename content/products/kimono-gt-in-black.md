<p><span>The Kimono GT was inspired by the term "Grand Touring" or "Gran Turismo" in Italian, a term that refers to cars that make long-distance drives in comfort and style. What better shape to take you the distance in your day? </span></p>
<p>This Kimono GT is built from an ultra modern silhouette and a boxy shape. Wear it like your favorite oversized cardigan to add authentic style to any outfit.</p>
<p>Racing stripe down the back will keep you in first place. </p>
<p>*This style runs intentionally large, so if you would like a more fitted silhouette, choose one size down.</p>
