<p>Introducing our new Sustainable Jacket line! First up, our newest take on the classic biker jacket includes sourcing responsibly and hand painting. This style has a slightly longer silhouette than our Signature Moto Jacket and two back vents for comfort and ease of movement. </p>
<p>This sustainable cotton fabric was sourced from over-ordered fabric from other designers and fabric warehouses. Utilizing this type of fabric allows me to reuse and divert these materials from the landfill and into your closet.</p>
<p>These jackets are handmade one at a time. Please allow 3 weeks to produce once ordered. Thank you!</p>
