<p><span>Our Short Kimono with 3/4 length sleeves looks lovely slipped over a lacy camisole, a flowing maxi dress or your favorite pair of jeans. The intricate Italian jacquard fabric edged in the softest moire will give you versatility and just the right amount of warmth. </span></p>
<p>Define your frame with the two sided belt or keep it breezily undone.</p>
<p>*This style runs intentionally large, so if you would like a more fitted silhouette, choose one size down.</p>
