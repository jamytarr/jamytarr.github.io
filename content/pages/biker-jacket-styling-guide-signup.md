<h4>Who doesn't love a jacket style that works with everything?</h4>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>Never worry about what you should wear for dinners with girlfriends, boardroom meetings, baseball games, date nights or a day at the art museum. I've got your covered in this Biker Jacket Styling Guide.</p>
<p>When I designed the J'Amy Tarr Biker Jacket, I took this classic shape and paired down all the snaps, belts, and metal hardware to reveal the essence of cool. To me, the tailored lines of this lean jacket speak volumes without weighing you down.</p>
<p>And who wants to be weighed down? I design jackets to allow you to shine through. Pure style, comfort and just the right amount of edge - I couldn't ask for anything more from a jacket!</p>
<p><strong>Hi, I'm J'Amy Tarr, and I've fit thousands of women in my outerwear collection over the years. I'm dedicated to helping women find a style that looks and feels great.</strong></p>
