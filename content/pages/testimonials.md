<p style="text-align: left;"> "Wearing a J'Amy Tarr Japanese wool coat is like a second skin.  It's soft, supple and just the right amount of warm. Her jackets elevate even a casual outfit!  Every time, I feel a little just a little better after I put one on!"</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"> "I was preparing for a presentation to a large client group in San Antonio. I had brought the Moto jacket to pair with a variety of things on the trip but originally planned to wear a black suit with skirt and white silk blouse on the day of the presentation. The presentation was a facilitated event that I was leading for a potentially challenging group of experts. The night before, I was considering my closet in the hotel room and the black suite felt like it would be lackluster. I wanted to feel more supported by my outfit and to have presence. The green Moto jacket's moire texture and color complemented the black skirt and white blouse. It's easy to dress up or down. When I walked into the meeting, a woman immediately said, "Nice jacket," making me feel very confident in my choice. I felt poised and comfortable throughout the five hour event, which went very well. I never felt the need to remove the jacket. It moved well and was the right weight. The client brought in a professional photographer so I felt even more pleased with my choice of the Moto jacket post event!"</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"> “As a designer, I think J’Amy Tarr is incredibly talented.  Her outerwear has a chic, modern edge that adds incredible sophistication to any outfit and a precision to her fit that compliment the silhouette.  I own both the Moto and the Mohair Bomber jackets, a cream and a black. The basic colors in her sophisticated designs allows the jackets to be worn interchangeably with casual daywear and evening attire.”</p>

I also love the fact J'Amy has it sewn in San Francisco and she personally touches all her pieces. It's a perfect combo of Madison Ave. style with Main Street service. I always feel confident and happy when I wear my J'Amy jacket!”<br></span><em></em></p>

<span>“I wear primarily jeans and t-shirts so my need for something tailored and fitted was limited, but when I walked in the studio to exchange a size for a purchase I had made at an auction, I was amazed with the quality, style and feel of J'Amy’s jackets.  They were more comfortable and warm than my fleece, and at the same time, made my basic t-shirt and jeans feel like uptown ready! I ended up buying 5 items and an additional two as gifts. The quality, style, fit and feel is unsurpassed!”<br></span><em></em>

<div style="text-align: left;">“When I first met J'Amy Tarr at a her trunk show at Crimson Mim, I literally wanted the jacket off her back.  The moto jacket was not only cool, but it was purple, my favorite color. I tried that on, but also spied the teal color.  And everyone in the store, including J'amy, thought the teal was better on me. Glad I listened. I wore J'Amy’s jacket to a very important interview -- and got the job!  I fell in love with J'Amy and her delicious coats and jackets. They're work appropriate but have that flair and edge that I love. How great that she's a local designer and makes her clothes locally too.  I can't wait to see what she designs next!”<em><em><span><br></span></em></em>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"> I absolutely love my J'Amy Tarr boucle zip bomber jackets!  I loved my first one so much, I bought a second one in another color in the last size they had left and J'Amy tailored it to fit me! She came right over and pinned the jacket and in 3 days I had a perfectly fitting garment!  The quality of her fabrics is gorgeous and her styles are so current.  These bomber jackets are timeless fashion and will be in my wardrobe for years!</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">"I love my J’Amy Tarr jackets not only because they’re made locally by a talented designer, but because they offer everything we search for in an outerwear garment. Her pieces are fashionable, without being trendy, high quality (and affordable!), and flexible! My favorite piece is the navy metallic bomber jacket because it's so hip and feels like I'm wearing functional art. People stop me all of the time and ask where I bought it."</p>
