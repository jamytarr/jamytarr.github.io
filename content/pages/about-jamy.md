<p style="text-align: left;">I’m an intuitive artist fascinated by the interplay of feminine power, ancestry, and transformation. My double MFA in Fashion and Applied Textile Design, along with two decades running my own fashion line in San Francisco, sharpened my sense of form, texture, and color. I’ve also studied under Jane Burton, Maggie Siner and Diane Williams—mentors who further shaped my experience in art.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Through my abstract paintings, I aim to reveal the spiritual threads that connect us across generations, especially through the lens of women’s lives. My work has been featured in a curated art program by Laurie Ghielmetti at Kneedler Fauchère Los Angeles and selected for juried shows by Orin Carpenter, Gayle Nicoletti, and Linda Larson at the O’Hanlon Gallery, as well as acquired by private collectors. Previously, my fashion work appeared in publications such as <em>Marin Magazine</em>, <em>The San Francisco Chronicle</em>, <em>Silicon Valley Magazine</em>, <em>The New York Post</em>, and <em>San Francisco Magazine</em>.</p>
