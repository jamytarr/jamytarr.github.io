<p>I create intuitive, abstract paintings that delve into the profound mysteries of feminine power, ancestry, and transformation. My background includes two MFAs and years spent leading my own fashion line in San Francisco—experiences that shaped my deep appreciation for form, texture, and color. In my artwork, I seek to illuminate the spiritual threads that connect us across generations, particularly through the lens of women’s lives.</p>
<p>Guided by a spontaneous and exploratory process, I layer colors and gestural marks to evoke both personal and collective memory. My recent work focuses on the cyclical nature of a woman’s life—how we shift and adapt through the changing seasons, holding both power and vulnerability in the same breath. I look to ancestral echoes, envisioning the voices of women who came before us, and channeling their stories of resilience, rage, and love into vibrant, textural images.</p>
<p>Ultimately, my goal is to spark moments of recognition—those flashes of truth where we remember that our individual journeys are entwined with a universal tapestry of experience. Through each painting, I aim to invite viewers into a shared space of contemplation, power, and possibility, where we can honor the complexities of being human, alive, and connected.</p>
