<div style="text-align: left;">The Girls this week are wearing garments inspired by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yurt" target="_blank" title="Mongolian Yurt" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mongolian Yurt</a>.  I love the earthy colors coupled with the deep red floral patterns. Throughout the day, the sunbeam spotlights various hand-woven rugs that cover the dirt floor. This image is rich in feeling and color. I thought about the stories those walls have seen and heard.</div>

<p>I pulled a color palette from the image below, which is represented in the fabric swatches on the bottom and right side of the inspiration board. Sometimes the most unexpected photograph has the best design inspiration. </p>
