<p>How did it become Friday already? This week <em>flew by</em>!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When experiencing a whirlwind week, find a moment to pause, reflect and make a conscious effort of becoming more mindful going forward. It can be challenging to not succumb into a mindless daily routine -- we’re guilty of this too!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take time to reflect and relax t</span>his weekend; find your happy place.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bright, hopeful spirit of having a fantastic weekend, here are some of our favorite links that we enjoyed this week at the J’Amy Tarr design studio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy weekend!</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese artist </span><a href="http://aiweiwei.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ai Weiwei</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created an </span><a href="http://www.lostateminor.com/2016/02/25/refugee-life-jackets-turned-into-art-is-both-beautiful-and-disturbing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eye-catching yet slightly gut-wrenching art installation attached to the famous Konzerthaus building in Berlin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A total of 14,000 bright orange discarded lifejackets were mounted on the six columns of the building to bring awareness to the plight of the refugees stuck at sea. Each jacket represents a person who landed in the Greek island of Lesbos after spending days – if not weeks – on a boat from Turkey.</span>

<a href="http://bryanderballa.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Derballa,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a Brooklyn photographer, uses his keen eye to </span><a href="http://www.huckmagazine.com/art-and-culture/photography-2/pictures-summer-nights-bathed-water-moonlight-anything-happen/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">document precious summer night moments before they pass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In his Huck Magazine article, Bryan states that he still craves “feeling of naive hope” and “raw energy” so he photographs “places where the anxieties of the city and responsibility wash away and we’re free to be who we’re meant to be.” These photos are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">breathtaking</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

Better yet, they appear to leap off the page. Mind blown.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/intelligence/karl-lagerfeld-on-the-state-of-fashion-its-a-mess" target="_blank">New York Fashion Week</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">came and passed. Fashion is beginning to experience major changes. Major fashion houses, like Tom Ford and Proenza Schouler, are going against the traditional fashion calendar. Instead, “See Now, Buy Now” is emerging; garments will be available right after their runway debuts. Karl Lagerfeld, one of fashion’s legendary figures, isn’t pleased. He </span><a href="http://www.oystermag.com/karl-lagerfeld-says-fashion-is-a-mess-will-make-collection-for-the-internet" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commented on this topic to Business of Fashion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calling the current industry "a mess."</span>
