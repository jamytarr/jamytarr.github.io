<p>Sometimes grey is the perfect non-color of all. Grey, a neutral color between black and white, is an achromatic color which means it's a color "without color". Often associated with business clothing, it symbolizes efficiency, focus and seriousness. However, the color grey can also exude soft sophistication and a sense of calm. I particularly love grey because inherent in it's neutrality, it allows the wearer's personality to shine through. </p>
