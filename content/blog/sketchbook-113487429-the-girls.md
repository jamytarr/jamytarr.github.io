<p>Here is part three of the collection. I've always been inspired by military shapes in jackets. These powerful shapes are suggested in the coat proportions above. The techniques include printed silks, leather weaving, appliqué, textured wools, window pane pattern making and suede details.</p>
<p>Color is very important, but to the degree that it is wearable. I believe that beautiful color can enhance an outfit tenfold. I am always one to grab a neutral as a base and then sometimes add a color to highlight my features or mood. </p>
