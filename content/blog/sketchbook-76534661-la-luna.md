<p>I've created a Pinterest board of Moon Phases and Moon Illustrations from vintage images to current 2016 paintings. I'd love to see some of these screen printed or appliquéd onto a jacket or dress. Clearly I am a fan of the Man on the Moon.</p>
<p>Check out this interesting rendering of the Moon Over Dark Waters, by Barbara Harmer, entirely constructed from handmade Japanese paper and covered with resin. I find it refreshing when artists use unexpected materials to create their art.  <a href="http://paintingwithpaper.net/2012/04/moon-over-dark-waters/" target="_blank" title="Moon Over Dark Waters" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://paintingwithpaper.net/2012/04/moon-over-dark-waters/</a> </p>
