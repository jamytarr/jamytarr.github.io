<div style="text-align: center;">Did you know you can wear a belt with our Tux Cape?</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">The key to this look is to loop the belt under the back of the cape while tucking in the front two bodice pieces. This is a sophisticated way to cinch the waist while rocking a modern A-lined menswear inspired shape. Pair it with a tuxedo pant or a black fitted denim, as seen above. I was wearing an ankle boot in a warm gray tone to break of all the black. From a practical perspective, this was a win, since I was on my feet all day. However, this would also look fantastic with a heel or modern sandal.</div>
