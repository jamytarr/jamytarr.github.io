<p>Last night when I sat down to draw our weekly fashion illustration installment - The Girls - I reflected on the latest news about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)" target="_blank" title="Prince" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince</a> and how his work had inspired me over the years.</p>
<p>Prince challenged how people thought and consequently created a whole new sound in the musical landscape. His style in both fashion and personal philosophies were revolutionary. I am honored to have had him alive in my lifetime.</p>
<p>This one is for you, Prince.</p>
<p>xo - J'Amy</p>
