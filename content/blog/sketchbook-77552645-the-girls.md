<p>After our recent editorial in <a href="http://www.marinmagazine.com/March-2016/Shades-of-Serenity/index.php?cparticle=8&amp;siarticle=7#artanc" target="_blank" title="March Marin Magazine" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marin Magazine</a>, I've been in the mood for brights!</p>
<p>Today's Friday Girls are feeling quite happy. I loosely drew these girls and gave them the brightest color explosion I could. Maybe it is just me, but I am having Spring Fever.</p>
<p>Here's wishing you a fantastic weekend!</p>
<p>xo J'Amy</p>
