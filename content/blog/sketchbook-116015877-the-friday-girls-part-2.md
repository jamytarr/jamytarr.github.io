<p>Happy Friday! This week, The Girls are wearing winter outfits continue to be inspired by a Mongolian Yurt. Although Mongolia is known for its warm summers, it is the long and dry winters I thought of for this mini collection. The jackets and coats worn by The Girls include shawl collars and belt details to ward off the chill. The mud soaked over-the-knee boots are made from thick chestnut suede. Hand quilted stitch details both add texture and warmth to their garments. The voluminous skirts are pleated and knee length to give them a slight femininity but still functional for the cool weather.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
