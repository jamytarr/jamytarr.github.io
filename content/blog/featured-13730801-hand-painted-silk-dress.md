<a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4698025253_dd32907869.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-124" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4698025253_dd32907869.jpg" alt="DPP_0018" width="200" height="300" /></a> I added the buckle detail to make the dress appear bound around the shoulders.  This print was engineered into eight panels.
