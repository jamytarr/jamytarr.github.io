<p>The Girls are sporting their sunglasses this Friday in hopes to see the sun this weekend. For the bulk of this piece I used BG and G series of <a href="https://imaginationinternationalinc.com/copic/" target="_blank" title="Copic Markers" rel="noopener noreferrer">Copic Markers</a> as well as the multiliner inking pens.</p>
<p>These Friday illustrations are weekly opportunities for me to lighten my stroke and experiment with color. The designs and color stories are picked randomly as I go. I am committing to have have no judgement when I draw these. My goals are to enjoy artistic freedom while creating line gesture, expression and color mixing. I will continue to share these images with you as I progress on this illustration journey.</p>
