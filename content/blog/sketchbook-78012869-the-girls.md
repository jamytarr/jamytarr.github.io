<p>It must be Friday! This week The Girls are featuring the Tuxedo aka the Dinner Jacket. The origins of the Tuxedo date back to the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704132204576285250103874450" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gilded Age </a>, however the no one really knows where the name Tuxedo came from.
