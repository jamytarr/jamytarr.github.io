<p>These girls are part a of a collection I did in 2003. I believe when you design timeless pieces, they are in fact timeless. I could see this collection on the runway today. It resonates as much today as it did 13 years ago. You can see appliqué techniques, leather piecing, metallic leather accents, suede fringe, leather braided embroidery, corsets and jumpsuits.</p>
<p>My point of view as a designer has always been to make clothing that will suit a person for years to come. Fast fashion is so boring to me. I'd take a timelessly cool jacket with a killer fit over a trendy outfit any day!</p>
