<p>Happy weekend from 'The Girls'!</p>
<p>As I'm in the middle of design and production for next season's fall/winter collection, I make it a priority to take a break. The best way to relax my mind is by designing garments that are polar opposite to my outerwear line. </p>
<p>This week I designed avant-garde dresses. </p>
<p>Avant-garde is a French term for experimental and innovative designs. This creative experimentation rejects the norm and prevents the industry from stagnating. </p>
<p>This unique fashion perspective allows me to play with new proportions, color combinations, textures and prints. I let my imagination run wild. </p>
