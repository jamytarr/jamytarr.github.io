<p>During the development stage of a collection, you need to sketch rough ideas of your outfits. These initial collection sketches help you finalize proportion, color and number of looks. Above, you will see this weeks girls are sketched in this draft style. Overall, you can see how the moodboard below was the initial inspiration for the collection. </p>

<p> This inspiration board includes lambskin, silk organza, wool, leather braid and a photo image of birds just taking flight. I printed the silk organza using pro reactive dyes and created the leather braid fabric to add innovative elements in the collection.</p>
