<p>Details matter. Small points of interest can tell an entire story on a garment. This week, I chose to use Chinese knotted frog closures. These are ornamental braiding that functions as a closure to garments. The "frog" combines a loop and a button. These closures are decorative as well as functional. When a garment uses many frogs, more than are actually needed to close the garment, it is called frogging. This week, I highlight the knotted frog as an interesting fashion detail.</p>
