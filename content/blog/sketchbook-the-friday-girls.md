<p>Happy Friday! The girls are giving you lots of color on this grey summer day in the Bay Area. The print was inspired by one of my favorite illustrators, Jeanette Getrost's vintage scarf. I decided to create a collection from this pattern and color story. I added a few afros and some halos for good measure. :)</p>
