<p>This week, The Girls are sporting springtime floral themes in Jade Green, Chinese Orange and Lemon Yellow Copic marker colors.</p>
<p>Each week when I sit down to draw the weekly illustration, I pick a color story that makes me happy. From there, it just flows. I did focus on loosening them up and and drawing them more quickly. Fashion figures are a designer's tool to communicate proportion, shape and overall tone/feeling of an outfit.</p>
