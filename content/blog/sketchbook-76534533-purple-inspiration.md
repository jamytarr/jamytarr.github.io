<p><a href="http://www.sensationalcolor.com/color-meaning/color-meaning-symbolism-psychology/all-about-the-color-purple-4329#.Vs4rspMrK8U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Purple</a> is one of those colors that emanates a feeling for me. This color often associated with nobility, power and wisdom, is a combination of blue (calm) and red (energy). These colors together create a calm curiosity that is a perfect starting point to dream up a new collection.</p>
