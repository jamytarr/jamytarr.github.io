<div><span>I'll let you in on a little secret.... I've started an illustration daily practice. </span></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<span>A concept I learned from my friend Lisa Anderson Shaffer with her book, </span><a href="https://www.lisaandersonshaffer.com/products/these-three-things-the-book" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-link-type="web" data-segment-action="add" data-segment-id="ebe053da-fe92-11ea-b990-d4ae529a8250">These Three Things</a><span>,</span><span> a daily journal that guides readers in the practice of capturing thoughts, insights and lessons learned each day. I decided to give it a try in my own way, through illustration. Plus, what better time to skill build than during 2020. No explanation needed there! So, whether it be yoga, meditation, art, writing or something you would like to dive deep into - there is no time like the present. </span>
