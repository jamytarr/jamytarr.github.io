<div style="text-align: center;">Happy Friday! Each week we will be posting a new version of "The Girls" for you to see. I will be experimenting with different markers, watercolors, gouache, pencils and pens. For now, I am going to go-with-the-flow and mess around with many different iterations until I come upon a style I like. Come back each Friday to see a new set of our "Friday Girls" illustrated for you! </div>
