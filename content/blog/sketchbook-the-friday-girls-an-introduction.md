<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet <em><strong>The Friday Girls</strong></em>, a fashion illustration depicting a band of women that are always dressed to the nines. These Girls emerge every Friday to celebrate life - they’re playful, cheerful and a creative side to ourselves! </span></p>
<p>Just like their vibrant outfits, each figure has taken on an animated personality. They’re spirited, whimsical, elegant but, most of all, they’re fun.</p>
<p>Who said fashion has to be serious?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I first began illustrating The Friday Girls, they were a way to experiment with brighter, more colorful capsule collections than I typically design. Over time, I found that these Girls are more than just a visual experimentation; rather, they represent freedom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These illustrations provide me with the space to play, without any inhibitions or second guesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a designer, taking time to let my imagination run wild is valuable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m excited to continue sharing The Girls with you, especially because they’re a snapshot of my personal life and journey. They’re a refreshing way to connect with you and the world around us!  </span></p>
