<p>Perhaps it was my black and white cat, Elvis, who inspired this week's monochrome edition of "The Girls". Initially, I started with a tonal leopard print which was intended to only be used as an accent. As I kept drawing and sketching, however, the illustration took a life of its own. Slowly, before I realized, the cat details took over - the theme of this week's Friday Girls installment took a new direction. </p>
<p>I enjoy letting my mind wander while illustrating these posts for our weekly series.</p>
<p>Have a good weekend! </p>
