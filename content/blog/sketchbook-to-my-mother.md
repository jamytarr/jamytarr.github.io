<p>There really is nothing like losing a mother. </p>
<p>I lost mine this summer. Your whole life flashes in front of your eyes. The finality is overwhelming. Yet, tremendous sadness and challenges in life present unique opportunities for reflection. My mother will always be with me and she loved my outerwear business. She was a cheerleader like no other and loved learning the business along side me. </p>
