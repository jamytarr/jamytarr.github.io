<p>Part two of 'The Girls'. These designs were inspired by the wildlife of <a href="http://www.marincountyparks.org/depts/pk/divisions/open-space" target="_blank" title="Open Space Marin" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marin Open Space</a> and German traditional hair braiding. Crazy combo, you say? That is what makes fashion inspiration so interesting. Take two completely unrelated topics and you blend them to speak one language. </p>
<p>This specific portion of the collection combines engineered pro-reactive painted/silkscreened silk cdc and organza with bonded wool back, weaving, leather fringe, <span>appliqué </span>braiding, buckles (on the backs) and window pane pattern making.</p>
<p>Come see these couture designs in person! Make an <a href="http://jamytarr.com/pages/introducing-the-jamy-tarr-design-studio-experience" target="_blank" title="J'Amy Tarr design studio experience appointment" rel="noopener noreferrer">appointment</a> to come into the newly remodeled design studio.</p>
