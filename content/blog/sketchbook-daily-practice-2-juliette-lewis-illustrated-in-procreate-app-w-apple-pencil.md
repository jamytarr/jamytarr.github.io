<p>Juliette Lewis is a living legend, as far as I'm concerned. She embodies a free spirit and a rock'n roll attitude that is unlike any other. Someone who lives life to the beat of her own drum, she has always been one of my favorites. She began acting at a very young age, received an Oscar nomination at 18 and threw herself completely into music and started <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliette_and_the_Licks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juliette and the Licks</a> at 30. </p>
<p>In this illustration, I took on a few challenges: illustrating someone that is a well-known celebrity and trying to navigate a major head tilt / proportion. After a few tries, I was happy enough with it. I think that if I got back in and work on this anymore, I would rough it up a bit, I'd lose some of the smoothness - but this is where it is now and I am taking a beat to analyze it.</p>
<p>I tried to showcase her personality a bit in the drawing through the line quality of the feather and shirt... Utilizing a sketchy-like vibe in expressing these components gave it an "undone" vibe contrasting with the polished high detailed shading of the face and skin, I think it balanced well. I would actually go deeper with this idea next time. </p>
<p>If you have someone you'd like to see illustrated, comment below! I'd love to hear.</p>
