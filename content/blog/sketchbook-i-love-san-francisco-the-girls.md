<p>This love affair I have with SF is the real deal.</p>
<p>I've lived in many places including NYC, Washington State and as far away as Granada Spain. There is no doubt that my heart has always been in San Francisco. The angle of the sun, the familiar smells and sights all resonate with me. I can remember my childhood in Marin, my wedding in the Presidio of San Francisco and raising my children in Marin. My love for the SF Bay Area is palpable and is present in every aspect of my life.</p>
