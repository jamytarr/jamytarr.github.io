<a href="http://jamytarr.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/2010-05-16-13-09-58.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-100" title="2010-05-16 13.09.58" src="/shopify-assets/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0182/5617/files/blog_w234_2010-05-16-13-09-58-4dac3324.jpeg" alt="" width="234" height="300" /></a> This was an engraving on zinc plate that I photographed at the Seattle Art Museum.  It was created by Georg Baselitz.  He was into death and suffering, and this was one of his bleakest works.
