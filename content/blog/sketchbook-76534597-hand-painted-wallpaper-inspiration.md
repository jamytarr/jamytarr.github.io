<p>There is something very special about hand painted wall paper. It juxtaposes a decor of yesteryear and brings it back-to-life in a warm and inviting way. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.carolinelizarraga.com/home.php" target="_blank" title="Caroline Lizarraga Hand Painted Wallpaper" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caroline Lizarraga</a> is a friend and artist who lives in the SF Bay Area. Her artistic range goes as far as the mind can take you from geometric shapes and lines to wicker texture, agate, marble and intricate patterns. She can paint referencing anything from historical to modern day design details all the while looking incredibly luxe. She even creates her designs in concrete floors! </p>
