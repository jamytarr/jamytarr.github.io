<p>This week, I explored different animal elements while illustrating The Girls.  I was drawn originally to the deep reddish browns of a Fox's coat, particularly fluffy and vibrant in the dead of winter. This color story, combined with a Sheep's curly matted hair gave me a sense of natural tension between these two animals. In that juxtaposition, I found harmony.</p>
