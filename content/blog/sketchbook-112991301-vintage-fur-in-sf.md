<p>Happy Friday! This time, "The Girls" are back in their best vintage frocks.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, I went vintage shopping in San Francisco's Mission district with my good friend and vintage soul sister, Wendy. We perused several shops within a 10 block radius of Valencia / 21st. After 5 hours of shopping with a short break for a scone and tea at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-blue-fig-san-francisco" target="_blank" title="the blue fig coffee shop" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Blue Fig</a>, I found a fire engine red mohair swing coat, 1950's kimono, an embroidered deep navy silk kimono, a rad crinoline, Prada skirt and black long sleeved lace sheath dress. Stay tuned for more about Wendy soon. You can follow her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PetulaVintage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p>
