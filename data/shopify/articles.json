When I think about form and function, a ballet costume is a clothing design feat.</p>\n<p>A ballerina needs to have a full range of movement while dancing in their costume. While at the same time, the costume is also an extension of that movement. The skirt moves at it's own pace, depending on fabric, and can enhance or exaggerate a leap or twirl.</p>\n<p>An interesting fact about ballet shoes in the 17th century is that the dancers traditionally wore heeled shoes! Skirts were shortened to mid calf in the 18th century and the tutu became the traditional costume in the 19th century. </p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/d.jsp?llr=kb5fquvab&amp;p=oi&amp;m=1122748266538&amp;sit=zjxfqedkb&amp;f=8a38cded-11c0-4fc2-ba54-91435ff48299\" class=\"button\" style=\"background-color: #e8e8e8; border: solid 1px #5b5b5b; color: #5b5b5b; display: inline-block; padding: 8px 10px; text-shadow: none;\">Join our list for 10% off</a>\n<div id=\"ctct_button_footer\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10px; color: #999999; margin-top: 10px;\">Be the first to hear about new product and events.</div>\n</div>",

    "body": "<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.2; font-size: 14px;\">Coats are a year round staple in San Francisco. Depending on the fabric weight, cut and color, you can find yourself wearing a coat in any of the Bay Area’s four seasons. Here are five tips to finding a high quality coat that you will wear for many seasons to come</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.2;\">.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/POH7V0kayS9zNUi9iLTIANG4h_yH88hkzIEG7q0LYIrPfwit7BrxnbiPvkZkBag5e_aYIr5HyOGfYoHc2EGGKlR38XGg8px1BySIlkDk1bPJHELTRTnX8-9EGQ\" width=\"308px;\" height=\"308px;\" style=\"line-height: 1.2;\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>1. The quality of the fabric is of utmost importance. One of the best materials for warmth and style is wool. Melton, a dense felted wool fabric, is one of the preferred fabrics for a </span><span>coat</span><span>. Melton is treated with heat and pressure to bind fibers together which makes it wind-resistant. Wool melton delivers comfort, warmth and elegance with a beautiful yet structured drape. Often wool melton fabrics are combined with a small amount of nylon for extra durability. Test the “hand” of the fabric or how it feels when touched. A high quality wool garment should be soft to the touch and not itchy or scratchy.</span></p>\n<span><span><br /><span></span></span></span>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>2. A </span><span>coat</span><span> should be well stitched. The top stitching should be clean, straight and evenly spaced. The seams should match and any pattern lines should line up.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qhXEGHTn8fqgDcUUsfnzfjsB_t4wUZjZm312Qo2mt97ir1KDFnmQT_ygRB5QFWGOF4LB2y6wkS4iMLRCXwetqGgIuoRuYt-J9nl-KaozbcLaHxkJx6_u9FS9dg\" width=\"295px;\" height=\"295px;\" /></p>\n<span><span><span></span></span></span>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>3. Well-made </span><span>coats</span><span> include </span><span>details</span><span> made with luxurious materials like genuine leather, high quality zippers or buttons and breathable linings. Coats that are lined will hang better and last longer. </span></p>\n<span><span><br /><span></span></span></span>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>4. On the interior of the coat, high-quality </span><span>coats</span><span> are manufactured with a fusible that reinforces certain parts of the interior of the garment. This fusible will prolong the life of the garment as well as maintain its shape over the years. A coat should have a gusset or pleat on the back lining to allow freedom of arm movement and bending</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>.</span><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FQ_6raYFoqMsu2bDvQcsG0HjsUJ62GJShHKjsvz7Pox6fCZe90HBZ6fUWEBFsZKIOnR96HmfBXej97R7HnmBWBd8OfG0UlRXgcA8wXgUZKCzvl03c5NO-onDxA\" width=\"295px;\" height=\"295px;\" /><span></span></p>\n<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-7e3fe1c6-b675-e594-48cd-256b40959edf\"><br /><span></span><span>5. As for styling, look for a coat that is flattering to your shape. Make sure the sleeves are long enough so it looks like it was made for you, hitting you below your wrist and above the base of your thumb. Color is important, especially if you are looking for a coat to take you through several seasons. A neutral dark color is the most versatile. It can take you from day to night with a few accessory changes.</span></span>",

These pieces pave the way for a more polished, coordinated outfit in minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in a quality jacket that will stand the test of time. While trends throughout each season’s </span><a href=\"http://mbfashionweek.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fashion Week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> change, the moto jacket continues to be a perennial favorite.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some tips on how to select the perfect moto jacket:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Fabric is everything</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Experiment with different types of fabric or leather to create distinct looks. Have a more edgy, urban allure? Opt for a leather moto jacket. Want clean lines and classic style? Try for a wool blend, similar to </span><a href=\"http://jamytarr.com/collections/all\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">J’Amy Tarr’s Japanese wool</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Pay attention to construction</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Rely on the capital rule of quality versus quantity when purchasing timeless garments. Garment seams should be feminine and flatter the natural flow of the body. Zippers, like stitch lines, should always lay flat and never appear wavy.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Accent with hardware</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Moto jackets are typically paired with asymmetrical zippers, studs, buckles or other bells and whistles. Ensure that each hardware piece doesn’t overwhelm, but, instead, flatters the body and final outfit choice. A more conservatively designed moto jacket may include fewer zippers while those appearing on the runway may showcase embellishments for an editorial effect.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<b>Play with proportions</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Explore various lengths and volumes of moto jackets to find the perfect match for individual body types and styles. Cropped (like this one from </span><a href=\"http://www.shopstyle.com/browse/leather-jackets/iro\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IRO</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), hip-length (try this one from </span><a href=\"http://www.rebeccataylor.com/jackets-coats-and-outerwear/metallic-leather-moto-jacket/invt/rt615415j605?source=239_75&amp;cm_mmc=google-_-shopping:%20product%20listing%20ads-_-sweaters%20&amp;%20cardigans-_-N&amp;gclid=COmy_7Gs3MoCFc2CfgodBKUBvg\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rebecca Taylor</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) or oversized (take a look at </span><a href=\"http://www.acnestudios.com/shop/women/coats-jackets/more-black.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acne Studios</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ style) are ever popular.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong><strong><br></strong></strong>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take style cues and fashion ideas from </span><a href=\"http://www.whowhatwear.com/how-celebrities-wear-moto-jackets/slide3\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">favorite celebrities</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or from influential bloggers like </span><a href=\"http://advicefromatwentysomething.com/dressing-for-early-fall-outfit/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advice from a Twenty Something</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><a href=\"http://www.editbylauren.com/blog//the-moto-and-jamy-tarr\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Edit by Lauren</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>",

This week, The Girls are wearing winter outfits continue to be inspired by a Mongolian Yurt. Although Mongolia is known for its warm summers, it is the long and dry winters I thought of for this mini collection. The jackets and coats worn by The Girls include shawl collars and belt details to ward off the chill. The mud soaked over-the-knee boots are made from thick chestnut suede. Hand quilted stitch details both add texture and warmth to their garments. The voluminous skirts are pleated and knee length to give them a slight femininity but still functional for the cool weather.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

Grey, a neutral color between black and white, is an achromatic color which means it's a color \"without color\". Often associated with business clothing, it symbolizes efficiency, focus and seriousness. However, the color grey can also exude soft sophistication and a sense of calm. I particularly love grey because inherent in it's neutrality, it allows the wearer's personality to shine through. </p>",

To help you sift through this all, we’re here to give you pointers on how to style it, what silhouettes work for you and what to expect.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Layering</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> -- From East to West Coast, the bomber jacket can adjust to nearly any region’s climates. To weather the various temperatures, make the </span><a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Layer-Clothes\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">layering technique</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your best friend. Bomber jackets nowadays possess a more feminine tailoring, which will eliminate any bulkiness when layering sweaters and thicker knit garments.</span></p>\n<p><b>Fabric</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> -- Not all bomber jackets are created equal. Consider different fabrics for different looks and occasions. For </span><a href=\"http://www.harpersbazaar.com/winter-fashion/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">autumn/winter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, try wearing a bomber jacket made of suede, leather or a soft wool, like Japanese wool. When </span><a href=\"http://cupofjo.com/2016/02/12-spring-2016-fashion-trends/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spring</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rolls in, try searching for lighter fabric, like </span><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">satin</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that’s airy but will still keep you warm during cooler nights. Playing with fabric means you can also play with styling; experiment by dressing it up for a night out or down for a casual yet still chic look.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Color</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> -- While the original bomber jacket was made in classic </span><a href=\"http://www.whowhatwear.com/tags/military-green-jacket/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">military green</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there now exists a vast array of colors to select from based on your personal style. Pair darker, sultry colors with date-night outfits. You can even go for a bold color to create an instant statement outfit regardless of pairing it with casual jeans or with a skirt.</span></p>\n<p><b>Fit</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> -- Womenswear bomber jackets typically have a more tailored fit. This more </span><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/01/31/it-look-flawless-tailorin_n_84234.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feminine silhouette</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will hug your body to give you a slimmer looks.  For more coverage, however, opt for a longer bomber jacket that hits beyond your hips.

Small points of interest can tell an entire story on a garment. This week, I chose to use Chinese knotted frog closures. These are ornamental braiding that functions as a closure to garments. The \"frog\" combines a loop and a button. These closures are decorative as well as functional. When a garment uses many frogs, more than are actually needed to close the garment, it is called frogging. This week, I highlight the knotted frog as an interesting fashion detail.</p>",

This approach is new for us; we’re forging a new path in the fashion industry with this method.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last month we released the ‘Take Flight’ Moto Jackets in cream and black as the first debut of our new concept. For October, we were inspired by vivid, rich colors and unique textures. We searched for the perfect combination of each that caught our eye.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Golden Gate Bridge\" src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0182/5617/files/Crimson_Concrete_Moodboard_1024x1024.jpg?v=1477028297\" style=\"float: none;\"></p>\n<p><strong>Crimson and Concrete</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our color story for this October collection is crimson and concrete.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crimson is a warm and positive color associated with strong, powerful energy. Historically, the color has been associated with nobility during the latter part of the Middle Ages throughout Europe. Crimson’s brazen hue drew us in and inspired us so much that we wanted to create a Bomber Jacket with it!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the city of San Francisco is a heavy influence for our brand, the color concrete truly stood out. The grey tinge of the city sidewalks to the rolling fog over the Golden Gate Bridge will forever remind us of the city we love so much - San Francisco.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0182/5617/files/Crimson_Concrete_Moodboard_2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1477028311\" alt=\"San Francisco city concrete photography\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Knit Bomber Jacket</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The knit texture of this new style gives the perpetually classic Bomber Jacket a new, refreshed look.

    "body": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0182/5617/files/Structured-Blazer-Hero-Image_1024x1024.jpg?v=1503881673\" style=\"float: none;\"></p>\n<p>I've been studying blazers for a long time. Fascinated by the overall shape of them, I look deep into the details. It's really all about the subtle details with blazers: length, lapel, collar, buttonhole(s), pleat or vent, double welt pocket or flap. There are so many variations of this classic shape that one must really think about their point of view when designing a unique one. </p>\n<p>I am a huge shawl collar fan. Notch and peak lapels feel really masculine and sometimes slightly forced. Maybe it is that I have seen a lot of things in my time, but I believe subtle references are often the strongest. The shawl collar has a refined smoothness. It channels Hollywood's great crooners but softens the edges and allows for the femininity to imbue.</p>\n<p>This jacket had to be a longer version since I feel that is extremely modern. It needed to be a sophisticated statement that would elongate the body and highlight the waist. The vintage inspired gold and silver filigree single button at center front and cuffs wink to a sophistication of yesteryear.</p>\n<p>This blazer is to be worn how it makes you feel empowered. I personally will wear this with jeans and a white tee most of the time, but it looks striking with a ruffly black dress, a silk tank and black tux trouser, a sleek tank dress or a crisp white button down and crop fitted pants. It will go the distance morning 'til night all while turning heads in your direction.</p>\n<p>xx - J'Amy</p>\n<div id=\"product-component-19fcea6cec9\"></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">// <![CDATA[\n(function () {\n  var scriptURL = 'https://sdks.shopifycdn.com/buy-button/latest/buy-button-storefront.min.js';\n  if (window.ShopifyBuy) {\n    if (window.ShopifyBuy.UI) {\n      ShopifyBuyInit();\n    } else {\n      loadScript();\n    }\n  } else {\n    loadScript();\n  }\n\n  function loadScript() {\n    var script = document.createElement('script');\n    script.async = true;\n    script.src = scriptURL;\n    (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(script);\n    script.onload = ShopifyBuyInit;\n  }\n\n  function ShopifyBuyInit() {\n    var client = ShopifyBuy.buildClient({\n      domain: 'jamytarr.myshopify.com',\n      apiKey: '25f938c6b1e68ee19c9a21ba809a6937',\n      appId: '6',\n    });\n\n    ShopifyBuy.UI.onReady(client).then(function (ui) {\n      ui.createComponent('product', {\n        id: [9863785680],\n        node: document.getElementById('product-component-19fcea6cec9'),\n        moneyFormat: '%24%7B%7Bamount%7D%7D',\n        options: {\n  \"product\": {\n    \"layout\": \"horizontal\",\n    \"variantId\": \"all\",\n    \"width\": \"100%\",\n    \"contents\": {\n      \"img\": false,\n      \"imgWithCarousel\": true,\n      \"variantTitle\": false,\n      \"description\": true,\n      \"buttonWithQuantity\": false,\n      \"quantity\": false\n    },\n    \"styles\": {\n      \"product\": {\n        \"@media (min-width: 601px)\": {\n          \"max-width\": \"100%\",\n          \"margin-left\": \"0\",\n          \"margin-bottom\": \"50px\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"title\": {\n        \"font-size\": \"26px\"\n      },\n      \"price\": {\n        \"font-size\": \"18px\"\n      },\n      \"compareAt\": {\n        \"font-size\": \"15px\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"cart\": {\n    \"contents\": {\n      \"button\": true\n    },\n    \"styles\": {\n      \"footer\": {\n        \"background-color\": \"#ffffff\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"modalProduct\": {\n    \"contents\": {\n      \"img\": false,\n      \"imgWithCarousel\": true,\n      \"variantTitle\": false,\n      \"buttonWithQuantity\": true,\n      \"button\": false,\n      \"quantity\": false\n    },\n    \"styles\": {\n      \"product\": {\n        \"@media (min-width: 601px)\": {\n          \"max-width\": \"100%\",\n          \"margin-left\": \"0px\",\n          \"margin-bottom\": \"0px\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"productSet\": {\n    \"styles\": {\n      \"products\": {\n        \"@media (min-width: 601px)\": {\n          \"margin-left\": \"-20px\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n      });\n    });\n  }\n})();\n// ]]></script>",

This style was designed with chilly mornings, crisp afternoons and breezy evenings in mind. Northern Californian's know that having thermo-versatility is key to dressing during these transitional months. </h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Enter the Funnel Neck Jacket. This jacket has a figure flattering shape that fits like a glove. The versatility comes from the diagonal center front zipper. Depending upon how far up you zip this jacket, you get a multitude of functionality.</h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">-Keep this jacket unzipped for a longer Motorcycle jacket shape with exaggerated lapels. </h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">-Zip it up to just above your waist to emphasize your hourglass shape. The diagonal design seaming adds to the shaping. To make the lapel smaller, just adjust by tucking in to the desired width.</h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">-For ultimate warmth, zip up jacket completely creating the \"funnel\" around your neck. Make sure to fold over each lapel by overlapping them when you zip it all the way up. This double layer of ultra soft brushed Japanese Wool at your neck allows you to leave your scarf at home!</h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<h3>We partnered with Kendall Chase, Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chasingkendall/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@chasingkendall</a> and Dawn Elizabeth at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dawnelizabethphoto/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@dawnelizabethphoto</a> for these photos showcasing a 'Day in the Life' in San Francisco.

I often use free association with color or shape to allow my eyes to readjust from previous collections. Once I've created a series of illustrations, I edit down to the specific details I like including shape, details and colors. By lining up my illustrations (above) and then editing down, I allow my designer instincts to take over and lead me to my next collection.</p>\n<p>Designers have several tools available to develop a collection. Dreaming up new styles in your mind, drawing them out by hand or on a computer, and utilizing fabric draping are all methods designers use to create 3D designs. All of these techniques are valuable at different times during the process. In the near future, we will see additional tools available to designers such as AI, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Artificial Intelligence</a>. I'm currently exploring AI now with my techie husband and looking forward to incorporating it into my designer toolbox soon. Stay tuned for future blog posts on AI for fashion design... This article from the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/business/21725599-technology-may-be-disrupting-peculiar-business-can-data-predict-fashion-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Economist</a> is interesting. I believe that fashion design can benefit by AI data as an informational tool, but the human element will continue to be essential in deciding the final outcome.</p>",

They are the perfect alternative to a jacket or coat this time of the year. What is even cooler about these pieces is that you can wear them over so many outfits: a bulky sweater, a batwing dress, a  button-down, an evening gown, a rocker tee, a turtleneck or even a silk tank. This Cape is one of our best sellers! It is extremely versatile and wonderful a conversation starter.</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0182/5617/files/best_celebrity_looks_3_2048x2048.jpg?v=1511196339\" style=\"float: none;\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"product-component-31f82a33b8b\"></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">// <![CDATA[\n(function () {\n  var scriptURL = 'https://sdks.shopifycdn.com/buy-button/latest/buy-button-storefront.min.js';\n  if (window.ShopifyBuy) {\n    if (window.ShopifyBuy.UI) {\n      ShopifyBuyInit();\n    } else {\n      loadScript();\n    }\n  } else {\n    loadScript();\n  }\n\n  function loadScript() {\n    var script = document.createElement('script');\n    script.async = true;\n    script.src = scriptURL;\n    (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(script);\n    script.onload = ShopifyBuyInit;\n  }\n\n  function ShopifyBuyInit() {\n    var client = ShopifyBuy.buildClient({\n      domain: 'jamytarr.myshopify.com',\n      apiKey: '25f938c6b1e68ee19c9a21ba809a6937',\n      appId: '6',\n    });\n\n    ShopifyBuy.UI.onReady(client).then(function (ui) {\n      ui.createComponent('product', {\n        id: [21896331280],\n        node: document.getElementById('product-component-31f82a33b8b'),\n        moneyFormat: '%24%7B%7Bamount%7D%7D',\n        options: {\n  \"product\": {\n    \"layout\": \"horizontal\",\n    \"variantId\": \"all\",\n    \"width\": \"100%\",\n    \"contents\": {\n      \"img\": false,\n      \"imgWithCarousel\": true,\n      \"variantTitle\": false,\n      \"description\": true,\n      \"buttonWithQuantity\": false,\n      \"quantity\": false\n    },\n    \"styles\": {\n      \"product\": {\n        \"@media (min-width: 601px)\": {\n          \"max-width\": \"100%\",\n          \"margin-left\": \"0\",\n          \"margin-bottom\": \"50px\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"title\": {\n        \"font-size\": \"26px\"\n      },\n      \"price\": {\n        \"font-size\": \"18px\"\n      },\n      \"compareAt\": {\n        \"font-size\": \"15px\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"cart\": {\n    \"contents\": {\n      \"button\": true\n    },\n    \"styles\": {\n      \"footer\": {\n        \"background-color\": \"#ffffff\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"modalProduct\": {\n    \"contents\": {\n      \"img\": false,\n      \"imgWithCarousel\": true,\n      \"variantTitle\": false,\n      \"buttonWithQuantity\": true,\n      \"button\": false,\n      \"quantity\": false\n    },\n    \"styles\": {\n      \"product\": {\n        \"@media (min-width: 601px)\": {\n          \"max-width\": \"100%\",\n          \"margin-left\": \"0px\",\n          \"margin-bottom\": \"0px\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"productSet\": {\n    \"styles\": {\n      \"products\": {\n        \"@media (min-width: 601px)\": {\n          \"margin-left\": \"-20px\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n      });\n    });\n  }\n})();\n// ]]></script>",

The daily grind of work - family - repeat is fantastic, but sometimes you need to shake it up. We talk about everything on our date nights. Recently, we've discussed setting business goals, planning vacations and overall catching up on where we are emotionally and mentally in the moment.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We recently grabbed a delicious meal at <a href=\"http://farmshopca.com/marin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FARMSHOP in Larkspur</a> Landing's Country Mart. They boast of \"innovative eclectic plates &amp; creative cocktails delivered in rustic-chic quarters\" See photo of me amongst the small vineyard in the back of the restaurant.</p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0182/5617/files/Screen_Shot_2019-08-23_at_3.22.21_PM_1024x1024.png?v=1566598963\" style=\"float: none;\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://jamytarr.com/collections/outerwear/products/structured-blazer-in-winter-floral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Structured Blazer</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">How I Wore It - I am not usually one for ruffles or super frilly outfits. In my opinion, a great pair of trousers, a hybrid cowboy low boot and a cool piece of jewelry are a solid foundation for one of my jackets. This time, I chose the Structured Blazer. It's got a really cool tuxedo vibe made from a textured cream fabric that reminds me of concrete. The high contrast black grosgrain lapel dresses up any outfit - even jeans. I love this super lean, structured shoulder jacket. You can flip the pocket flap out or in, depending upon the proportion you want.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Masculine tailoring coupled with a streamlined silhouette made just for a woman is a winning combo. It's my go-to for date night, the office, ladies night out or just about anywhere you want a little tailoring to compliment your outfit. Wear it with a maxi skirt, a ripped boyfriend jean, a dark skinny jean, a trouser, a wide leg pant or a ruffled dress. It works perfectly every time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"product-component-d959a12ee04\" style=\"margin: auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">// <![CDATA[\n(function () {\n      var

A design is cut into the linoleum surface with a sharp blade or gauge. When ink is rolled over the raised areas with a brayer, it creates a mirror image of the carving.

How do you incorporate them into your style without looking over-the-top? Does wearing metallics look out-of-place if you are in a low key environment or setting? Let's discuss...</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">First of all, I'm a big believer in that you can wear whatever you want. If wearing metallics makes you feel ________  (fill in the blank - strong, sensual, pretty, smart, worldly, spiritual, confident, graceful, creative etc) then they are right for you.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">People have worn precious metals since the beginning of time. Today's favorites include 14K -18K yellow, white or rose gold jewelry - these pieces have have heavy rotation in today's wardrobe. It's easier to wear metallics this way because of their size in relation to your whole outfit. Compared to a shirt, jacket or pant, a piece of jewelry is usually an accent. I believe that going bold and sophisticated with metallics no matter what the current fashion trend du jour is always a good idea. A little metallic glam for the WIN.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0182/5617/files/ChasingKendall_2__0799_1024x1024.jpg?v=1595265679\" alt=\"\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">When choosing which metal is right for you, it helps if the color suits your skin tone. In the photo above, Blogger Kendall Chase @chasingkendall www.chasingkendall.com wears this soft gold color perfectly. Her coloring is warm with honey tones. If you want to find out your skin tone, it is recommended to stick your arm out in front of your body and flip your palm up towards the sky. The underside of your arm will help you decide. Hold up a piece of silver jewelry and then a piece of gold. Which one looks better?</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">Warm skin tones tend to look best in gold. bronze, copper and pewter. I love our Gold &amp; Ivory Denim Bomber jacket, seen on Kendall above, because its metallic tone is less \"yellowy\" and more of a lighter gold. This type of gold tone is easier to wear and looks elegant paired with a dress or more casually with jeans. People who wear gold tend to look better in muted warm colors such as camel, bronze, mocha, blush, browns, beige and charcoal grey.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<span><span>In fashion, rules are made to be broken. Don't let some old adage hold you back from realizing your full style potential. What you wear and how it makes you feel is by far the most important factor! Fashion and styling \"rules\" can help, but your own experience is paramount. </span></span>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0182/5617/files/Marin-Mag-Gold-Bomber-tennis_2048x2048.jpg?v=1600104940\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048x2048\" height=\"2048x2048\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0182/5617/files/Marin_Mag_gold_bomber_3_7f1891d5-66ef-44f2-894f-1396914a2f71_2048x2048.jpg?v=1600104747\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048x2048\" height=\"2048x2048\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div id=\"product-component-1595266954473\"></div>\n</div>",

Growing up in the SF Bay Area, I know chilly, yet often temperate, weather. This means for most of the year, I can wear a mid-weight jacket or coat over my outfit and be pretty set for the day, save for an occasional cashmere scarf or hat on those extra cold winter days.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">One of my go-to pieces is the Kimono GT coat. This is a 9 month'r meaning you can wear this from September -&gt; May and then occasionally during the \"June Gloom\" segment of the year as well. That's a lot. This jacket is just the right amount of warmth, style and versatility to be a favorite.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">Great styling options for the Kimono GT:</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">- Wear a single color top and pant for a polished look with a sandal.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">- Wear a pair of deconstructed denim and a tank with mens oxfords.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">- Wear a turtle neck with a pencil skirt &amp; an ankle boot.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">- Wear a mini-skirt with tights and a rock n' roll tee with an ankle boot.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">- Wear a sweater dress, tights and a tall boot with a unique heel detail.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:

She shot some images of me while we were cruising around SF's Chinatown to capture the vibrant colors of this part of the city. Coincidentally, the red of my dress matched the lanterns floating above the streets. It made for a lovely photo. One of the Daria's talents is how she captures composition and architecture. More on her in future blog posts, you will LOVE how she captured this beautiful city. My wool Kimono GT in Dark Navy was the perfect weigh to keep me warm, but remained comfortable throughout our jaunt around town. This coat, and the rest of my collection is 100% designed, developed, graded, cut and sewn within a 60 mile radius of my studio. All garments are produced in small quantities so to keep waist down and quality up.</div>\n<div id=\"product-component-1600120959740\"></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">// <![CDATA[\n(function

I bet you don't feel the same when you get off of Instagram, for example, then you do when you get off Pinterest. These tech companies have different intentions and business models. Some are more questionable to your well being than others. How do you protect yourself and your state of mind? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span>If you have an iPhone, the first way to protect yourself would be to update your phone to iOS 14. Once you do, you are now in charge of which apps can have access to your behavior on the phone. Did you know that all of your apps before this update had automatic access to your unique phone's internal number which allowed them to track your every move online? Many of us would say, well, what's the big deal? In time, you will learn that there is a new commodity and it's called human futures. Sounds frightening. What it means is that we are the product. Our attention is being bought and sold and we aren't even halfway aware of it.</p>\n<p>Watch The Social Dilemma and you will see how social media is manipulating you on such a deep level, that it is shocking.

She embodies a free spirit and a rock'n roll attitude that is unlike any other. Someone who lives life to the beat of her own drum, she has always been one of my favorites. She began acting at a very young age, received an Oscar nomination at 18 and threw herself completely into music and started <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliette_and_the_Licks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Juliette and the Licks</a> at 30. </p>\n<p>In this illustration, I took on a few challenges: illustrating someone that is a well-known celebrity and trying to navigate a major head tilt / proportion. After a few tries, I was happy enough with it. I think that if I got back in and work on this anymore, I would rough it up a bit, I'd lose some of the smoothness - but this is where it is now and I am taking a beat to analyze it.</p>\n<p>I tried to showcase her personality a bit in the drawing through the line quality of the feather and shirt... Utilizing a sketchy-like vibe in expressing these components gave it an \"undone\" vibe contrasting with the polished high detailed shading of the face and skin, I think it balanced well. I would actually go deeper with this idea next time. </p>\n<p>If you have someone you'd like to see illustrated, comment below! I'd love to hear.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0182/5617/files/juliette-lewis-high-res_1024x1024.jpg?v=1601322898\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Reference photo by Anthony Saint James</p>\n<p>Great article about Juliette Lewis in <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/juliette-lewis-talks-new-rock-doc-working-with-dave-grohl-40757/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rolling Stone Magazine</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"l-article-content\">\n<div class=\"c-content t-copy\">\n<div class=\"pmc-paywall\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n<!-- Begin Constant Contact Inline Form Code -->\n<div class=\"ctct-inline-form\" data-form-id=\"3353df39-7dfa-4985-bfe1-d2e31dc52038\"></div>\n<!-- End Constant Contact Inline Form Code -->",

No place inspires my outerwear pieces more than San Francisco and it's fickle weather patterns. One minute you are freezing and the next you're warm. This city has taught it's inhabitants to love layers. While San Francisco may not be known for it's <a href=\"http://www.sanfrancisco.com/weather/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vibrant seasons</a>, people here know that it is quite usual to experience a few seasons in just a single day.</p>\n<p><br>With the unique San Francisco weather patterns in mind, I wanted to design a jacket that could allow the wearer to bundle up or down as their day progressed. Knowing that at any moment the fog can roll in under the Golden Gate Bridge and cool the city off by 20-30 degrees in minutes.</p>\n<p><br>Meet the Funnel Neck Jacket. Named after the shape of it's collar, the Funnel Neck Jacket was designed to keep you comfortable throughout your day from crisp mornings to moderate warm afternoons and back to cold foggy nights.

If you are interested in seeing how she created it, check it our <a href=\"http://thebeautifulcircus.com/2018/10/15/sacred-heart-dia-de-los-muertos-costume/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">I absolutely love what Día de los Muertos stands for.  It brings people together annually to celebrate in life-affirming joy and pay respect to those loved ones who have passed. In the spirit, I dedicate this illustration to my mom. ❤️</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">To read more about Día de los Muertos, here's a great <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/north-america/mexico/top-ten-day-of-dead-mexico/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Geographic's article</a> highlighting the top 10 things to know about this celebration.</div>",

    "body": "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Musings from J'Amy's Journal:</strong></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span>I've been thinking about how we are going to dress as we move into fall/winter and onwards into 2021. With the Holidays just ahead of us and the vaccine on the horizon, we are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. But where to start with fashion? How have things changed? What's going to feel right going forward? I'm going to explore these ideas in a series of upcoming blog posts discussing what feels right for right now. I will show you easy ways to pull a look together, I'll push you to try something new and show you when you leave something a little \"off\" or \"undone\" it is </span><span>way</span><span> more cool than being perfect.</span>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>With sustainability on our minds, let's start by shopping our own closets. Below, I shopped my closet for outfits that worked with my Olive Biker Jacket. If you own a similar jacket, hopefully these ideas will help you too. I've noticed that I've been wearing sweats so much these past few months that it feels good to grab a sweater, trouser and jacket instead of wearing my pjs all day. Fashion is powerful and can change the way you feel. </span></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0182/5617/files/Green_Simple_Vertical_Minimalist_Your_Story_2_1024x1024.png?v=1605211444\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: none;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Olive Biker Jacket is a fitted jacket. This allows you to push the volume a little on the bottom to balance it out. In the top image, I have an asymmetrical dress hem hitting just below my knees. This gives some interest and mirrors the asymmetry of the jacket. The hat gives it a more cozy Stevie Nicks fall feeling.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The middle image showcases a burgundy sequin skirt which give a little wow factor. Since I paired it with an olive cotton tank, it takes it down a notch and makes it more approachable. This jacket and the color feel more casual and juxtapose the elevated vibe of the sequin skirt.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The bottom photo shows how plum is a great pairing with olive. This skirt has a trumpet shape. The shape is flattering and gives volume but only at the base. I paired with black pumps and unexpected black socks. This combo is very cool, and you don't catch it at first glance. But once you see it, it makes you think. Those details show that you are creative and challenging the norm by choosing to do your own thing.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0182/5617/files/Green_Simple_Vertical_Minimalist_Your_Story_3_c9888bbf-f812-4c30-96a0-c5d8d4b5c168_1024x1024.png?v=1605211485\" alt=\"\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">In these second three, I keep it really simple. The top shows a wide leg crop pant with a graphic tank top and black suede ankle boots. </div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The middle showcases a full black sequin dress with the Olive Biker Jacket over the shoulders. This is a great example of where you take a super elevated look and tone it way down with the wool jacket. It shows the high/low and balances them into the perfect combo. Worn with the black pump and black sock to keep it interesting and a little \"off\" --&gt; which is good.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The bottom is a rust sweater with black crop wide leg pant. Worn with black suede ankle boots, this is both warm and comfy! Throw the jacket over your shoulders for a slightly preppy vibe.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0182/5617/files/Green_Simple_Vertical_Minimalist_Your_Story_4_1024x1024.png?v=1605211535\" alt=\"\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">I wanted to show a look with jeans. The Olive Biker looks GREAT with blue denim, but here I am wearing it with a dark charcoal colored denim with raw hem. I folded up the hem to finish it, added a white patent leather shoe and a string of pears with a large pendant. </div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The middle look is paired with a long black ruffle culotte and a plum colored croc embossed tall boot. This is another good example of where  more volume on the bottom balances out the fitted jacket on top.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The final image shows how sleek the jacket looks with a burgundy wrap dress. Clean, simple and chic. The unexpected pairing of the black pump slingback and black socks keep the viewer guessing.</div>\n<div id=\"product-component-1605213569912\"></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">//

It's modern to step away from the 100% body con look. It's too much and not fresh. Seen here, with oversized jeans, it balances the fitted jacket and makes it look effortless and chic. Grocery store run, coffee date with mask! or walking the dog.

I know if I wore this dress by itself, I'd feel uncomfortable - not like myself. If I added the Sage Biker Jacket over it, I'd feel more like myself with a calming neutral to balance it out. The combat boots calm it down even a little more. To me, this balance feels modern and fresh.

This is a sophisticated way to cinch the waist while rocking a modern A-lined menswear inspired shape. Pair it with a tuxedo pant or a black fitted denim, as seen above. I was wearing an ankle boot in a warm gray tone to break of all the black. From a practical perspective, this was a win, since I was on my feet all day. However, this would also look fantastic with a heel or modern sandal.</div>",

The journey begins with intuitive mark-making, where spontaneity leads and each stroke is a step toward something bigger.<br><br>Working with a larger canvas is liberating. It invites me to use bigger brushes and get creative with tools, painting not just with bristles but with whatever can leave an interesting mark. The goal? To strike a visual balance that feels just right—where fluid lines meet bold, dramatic strokes.<br><br>I want my art to spark conversations.

Art, in its myriad manifestations, acts as a medium through which the complex, often contradictory facets of human emotions are conveyed and comprehended. It transcends the boundaries of mere aesthetic appeal, venturing into the depths of our emotional landscapes, both bright and shadowed.</p>\n<p>In the act of creation, artists reach into the core of their emotional experiences, drawing out feelings that might be sublime or disturbing, serene or chaotic. This process is not just a means of personal catharsis or expression; it establishes a profound communicative link between the creator and the audience. When we engage with art—be it a piece of music, a painting, or a literary work—we are often moved beyond mere intellectual appreciation. We find ourselves resonating with the emotions embedded in these works, sometimes experiencing a profound empathetic connection with the artist's inner world.</p>\n<p>Art also serves as a unique language of emotions, allowing for the expression of nuanced emotional states that might be difficult to articulate in words. This language is not static; it evolves and expands, offering both artists and audiences new ways to understand and articulate complex emotional experiences. Through art, we can explore the subtleties of our feelings, distinguishing between closely related emotions and gaining a deeper understanding of our emotional responses.</p>\n<p>Art's impact on our emotions is both immediate and reflective. It can elicit a range of responses, from awe and surprise to contemplation and introspection, highlighting the diverse ways in which we interact with and are affected by art. This interaction is not limited to the conscious level; it often involves an intricate interplay between our cognitive processes and emotional responses, enriching our experience of art.</p>\n<p>In essence, art in its various forms offers a powerful means for exploring and expressing the rich tapestry of human emotions. It is both a reflection of our inner selves and a window into the emotional experiences of others, providing a bridge between personal expression and collective understanding. Through art, we gain insights into the human condition, exploring the myriad emotions that define and shape our experience of the world.</p>\n</div>",
